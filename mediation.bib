  abstract = "In genetics, pleiotropy describes the genetic effect of a single
              gene on multiple phenotypic traits. A common approach is to
              analyze the phenotypic traits separately using univariate
              analyses and combine the test results through multiple
              comparisons. This approach may lead to low power. Multivariate
              functional linear models are developed to connect genetic variant
              data to multiple quantitative traits adjusting for covariates for
              a unified analysis. Three types of approximate F-distribution
              tests based on Pillai-Bartlett trace, Hotelling-Lawley trace, and
              Wilks's Lambda are introduced to test for association between
              multiple quantitative traits and multiple genetic variants in one
              genetic region. The approximate F-distribution tests provide much
              more significant results than those of F-tests of univariate
              analysis and optimal sequence kernel association test (SKAT-O).
              Extensive simulations were performed to evaluate the false
              positive rates and power performance of the proposed models and
              tests. We show that the approximate F-distribution tests control
              the type I error rates very well. Overall, simultaneous analysis
              of multiple traits can increase power performance compared to an
              individual test of each trait. The proposed methods were applied
              to analyze (1) four lipid traits in eight European cohorts, and
              (2) three biochemical traits in the Trinity Students Study. The
              approximate F-distribution tests provide much more significant
              results than those of F-tests of univariate analysis and SKAT-O
              for the three biochemical traits. The approximate F-distribution
              tests of the proposed functional linear models are more sensitive
              than those of the traditional multivariate linear models that in
              turn are more sensitive than SKAT-O in the univariate case. The
              analysis of the four lipid traits and the three biochemical
              traits detects more association than SKAT-O in the univariate
              case.",

  abstract = "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified thousands of
              variants associated with complex traits, but their biological
              interpretation often remains unclear. Most of these variants
              overlap with expression QTLs (eQTLs), indicating their potential
              involvement in the regulation of gene expression. Here, we
              propose an advanced summary statistics-based Mendelian
              Randomization approach that uses multiple SNPs jointly as
              instruments and multiple gene expression traits as exposures,
              simultaneously. When applied to 43 human phenotypes it uncovered
              2,277 putative genes whose blood expression is causally
              associated with at least one phenotype resulting in 5,009
              gene-trait associations; of note, 55\% of them had no genome-wide
              significant SNP nearby in previous GWAS analysis. Using
              independent association summary statistics (UKBiobank), we
              confirmed that the majority of these loci were missed by
              conventional GWAS due to power issues. Noteworthy among these
              novel links are height- and intelligence-associated PEX19 and
              CDC42, respectively known to carry mutations leading to short
              stature and Takenouchi-Kosaki syndrome. We similarly unraveled
              novel pleiotropic causal effects suggestive of mechanistic
              connections, e.g. the shared genetic effects of TSPAN14 in
              rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn9s and inflammatory bowel disease.
              Finally, we show that causal genes can be highly tissue-specific.
              Our advanced Mendelian Randomization unlocks hidden value from
              published GWAS through higher power in detecting associations. It
              better accounts for pleiotropy and unravels new biological
              mechanisms underlying complex and clinical traits.",

              pleiotropic effects. What underlies this phenomenon is the
              biological connection among seemingly unrelated traits/diseases.
              Characterizing the molecular mechanisms of pleiotropy not only
              helps to explain the relationship between diseases, but may also
              contribute to novel insights concerning the pathological
              mechanism of each specific disease, leading to better disease
              prevention, diagnosis and treatment. However, most pleiotropic
              effects remain elusive because their functional roles have not

              availability of qualified measurements at multilayered biological

              significantly higher PANSS-positive scores ($\beta$ = 3.95, P =

              impaired ERP (unadjusted P = 0.01; R2 = 3.07\%). We also found a
              significant positive association between the college-PRS and
              globally impaired ERP (FDR-corrected P = 0.004; R2 = 6.15\%). The
              effect of college-PRS on PANSS positivity was almost entirely
              (97.1\%) mediated through globally impaired ERP. These results
              suggest that the globally impaired ERP phenotype may represent
              some aspects of brain physiology on the path between genetic
              influences on educational attainment and psychotic symptoms.",

               well-established results of biometry in accordance with the

               ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more
               general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in
               which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will
               be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human
               variability. The great body of available statistics show us that
               the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very
               closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the
               variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation
               corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When
               there are two independent causes of variability capable of
               producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with
               standard deviations $\sigma$1 and $\sigma$2, it is found that
               the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard
               deviation . It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of
               variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as
               the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the
               Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may
               now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages
               of the total variance which they together produce. It is
               desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis
               of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood,
               and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that
               loose phrases about the ``percentage of causation,'' which

               widely used in genetics applications, including, recently,
               polygenic modeling in genome-wide association studies. These two
               approaches make very different assumptions, so are expected to
               perform well in different situations. However, in practice, for
               a given dataset one typically does not know which assumptions
               will be more accurate. Motivated by this, we consider a hybrid
               of the two, which we refer to as a ``Bayesian sparse linear
               mixed model'' (BSLMM) that includes both these models as special
               cases. We address several key computational and statistical
               issues that arise when applying BSLMM, including appropriate
               prior specification for the hyper-parameters and a novel Markov

               pathways, to identify gene sets that are enriched for variants
               associated with disease. We develop a model-based approach to
               pathway analysis, and apply this approach to data from the
               Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) studies. Our
               method offers several benefits over existing approaches. First,
               our method not only interrogates pathways for enrichment of
               disease associations, but also estimates the level of
               enrichment, which yields a coherent way to promote variants in
               enriched pathways, enhancing discovery of genes underlying
               disease. Second, our approach allows for multiple enriched
               pathways, a feature that leads to novel findings in two diseases
               where the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a major
               determinant of disease susceptibility. Third, by modeling
               disease as the combined effect of multiple markers, our method
               automatically accounts for linkage disequilibrium among
               variants. Interrogation of pathways from eight pathway databases
               yields strong support for enriched pathways, indicating links
               between Crohn's disease (CD) and cytokine-driven networks that
               modulate immune responses; between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
               ``Measles'' pathway genes involved in immune responses triggered
               by measles infection; and between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and
               IL2-mediated signaling genes. Prioritizing variants in these
               enriched pathways yields many additional putative disease
               associations compared to analyses without enrichment. For CD and
               RA, 7 of 8 additional non-MHC associations are corroborated by
               other studies, providing validation for our approach. For T1D,
               prioritization of IL-2 signaling genes yields strong evidence
               for 7 additional non-MHC candidate disease loci, as well as
               suggestive evidence for several more. Of the 7 strongest
               associations, 4 are validated by other studies, and 3 (near IL-2
               signaling genes RAF1, MAPK14, and FYN) constitute novel putative

              Availability of summary data of genetic associations for a
              variety of phenotypes from large genome-wide association studies
              (GWAS) allows straightforward application of MR using summary
              data methods, typically in a two-sample design. In addition to
              the conventional inverse variance weighting (IVW) method,
              recently developed summary data MR methods, such as the MR-Egger
              and weighted median approaches, allow a relaxation of the
              instrumental variable assumptions. Methods: Here, a new method -
              the mode-based estimate (MBE) - is proposed to obtain a single
              causal effect estimate from multiple genetic instruments. The MBE
              is consistent when the largest number of similar (identical in
              infinite samples) individual-instrument causal effect estimates
              comes from valid instruments, even if the majority of instruments
              are invalid. We evaluate the performance of the method in
              simulations designed to mimic the two-sample summary data
              setting, and demonstrate its use by investigating the causal
              effect of plasma lipid fractions and urate levels on coronary
              heart disease risk. Results: The MBE presented less bias and
              lower type-I error rates than other methods under the null in
              many situations. Its power to detect a causal effect was smaller
              compared with the IVW and weighted median methods, but was larger
              than that of MR-Egger regression, with sample size requirements
              typically smaller than those available from GWAS consortia.
              Conclusions: The MBE relaxes the instrumental variable
              assumptions, and should be used in combination with other
              approaches in sensitivity analyses.",

  author    = "Davey Smith, George and Ebrahim, Shah",
  abstract  = "Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in
               observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus
               misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and
               analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization---the random
               assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during
               gamete formation and conception---provides one method for
               assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The
               association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the
               biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not
               generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding
               that may distort interpretations of conventional observational
               studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of
               polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence
               of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are
               described. The limitations of the approach include confounding
               by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism
               under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic
               effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable
               polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and
               canalization---the buffering of the effects of genetic variation
               during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization
               provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates
               how investment in the human genome project may contribute to
               understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health
               of modifiable exposures.Genetic epidemiology---the theme of this
               issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology---is seen by
               many to be the only future for epidemiology, perhaps reflecting
               a growing awareness of the limitations of observational
               epidemiology1 (Box 1). Genetic epidemiology is concerned with
               understanding heritable aspects of disease risk, individual
               susceptibility to disease, and ultimately with contributing to a
               comprehensive molecular understanding of pathogenesis. The
               massive investment and expansion of human genetics, if it is to
               return value for the common good, must be integrated into public
               health functions. The human genome epidemiology network (HuGE
               Net---http://www.cdc.gov/genetics/huge.htm) has been established
               to promote the use of genetic knowledge---in terms of genetic
               tests and services---for disease prevention and health
               promotion.2,3 A broad taxonomy of human genome studies of public
               health relevance has been developed4 (Box 2). In this issue of
               the IJE, we publish a paper by Miguel Porta,5 who highlights the
               need for a more rational approach to genetic testing, given the
               likely low penetrance of many genes associated with cancers,6
               likening the role of the genome to a jazz score that is
               interpreted and developed through experience and context---and
               is seldom predictable. Such insights may well temper enthusiasm
               for genetic testing in populations. However, in parallel to the
               approaches advocated by HuGE, genetic epidemiology can lead to a
               more robust understanding of environmental determinants of
               disease (e.g. dietary factors, occupational exposures, and
               health-related behaviours) relevant to whole populations (and
               not simply to genetically susceptible sub-populations).7--10
               This approach has recently been referred to as `Mendelian
               randomization'.11--15 Here we begin by briefly reviewing reasons
               for current concerns about aetiological findings generated by
               conventional observational epidemiology and then we outline the

              mutant phenotypes, is a relatively common but poorly understood
              phenomenon in biology. Perhaps the greatest challenge in the
              analysis of pleiotropic genes is determining whether phenotypes
              associated with a mutation result from the loss of a single
              function or of multiple functions encoded by the same gene. Here
              we estimate the degree of pleiotropy in yeast by measuring the
              phenotypes of 4710 mutants under 21 environmental conditions,
              finding that it is significantly higher than predicted by chance.
              We use a biclustering algorithm to group pleiotropic genes by
              common phenotype profiles. Comparisons of these clusters to
              biological process classifications, synthetic lethal
              interactions, and protein complex data support the hypothesis
              that this method can be used to genetically define cellular
              functions. Applying these functional classifications to

  abstract = "We performed a genome-wide scan for genetic variants that
              influence multiple human phenotypes by comparing large
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 40 traits or diseases,
              including anthropometric traits (e.g. nose size and male pattern
              baldness), immune traits (e.g. susceptibility to childhood ear
              infections and Crohn9s disease), metabolic phenotypes (e.g. type
              2 diabetes and lipid levels), and psychiatric diseases (e.g.
              schizophrenia and Parkinson9s disease). First, we identified 307
              loci (at a false discovery rate of 10\%) that influence multiple
              traits (excluding ``trivial'' phenotype pairs like type 2
              diabetes and fasting glucose). Several loci influence a large
              number of phenotypes; for example, variants near the blood group
              gene ABO influence eleven of these traits, including risk of
              childhood ear infections (rs635634: log-odds ratio = 0.06, P =
              1.4 $\times$ 10−8) and allergies (log-odds ratio = 0.05, P = 2.5
              $\times$ 10−8), among others. Similarly, a nonsynonymous variant
              in the zinc transporter SLC39A8 influences seven of these traits,
              including risk of schizophrenia (rs13107325: log-odds ratio =
              0.15, P = 2 $\times$ 10−12) and Parkinson's disease (log-odds
              ratio = -0.15, P = 1.6 $\times$ 10−7), among others. Second, we
              used these loci to identify traits that share multiple genetic
              causes in common. For example, genetic variants that delay age of
              menarche in women also, on average, delay age of voice drop in
              men, decrease body mass index (BMI), increase adult height, and
              decrease risk of male pattern baldness. Finally, we identified
              four pairs of traits that show evidence of a causal relationship.
              For example, we show evidence that increased BMI causally
              increases triglyceride levels, and that increased liability to
              hypothyroidism causally decreases adult height.",

               discover the coordinated control of these traits via genotyped
               polymorphisms. A common statistical approach to this problem
               involves assessing the relationship between each phenotype and
               each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually (PHN);
               and taking a Bonferroni correction for the effective number of
               independent tests conducted. Alternatively, one can apply a
               dimension reduction technique, such as estimation of principal
               components, and test for an association with the principal
               components of the phenotypes (PCP) rather than the individual
               phenotypes. Building on the work of Lange and colleagues we
               develop an alternative method based on the principal component
               of heritability (PCH). For each SNP the PCH approach reduces the
               phenotypes to a single trait that has a higher heritability than
               any other linear combination of the phenotypes. As a result, the
               association between a SNP and derived trait is often easier to
               detect than an association with any of the individual phenotypes
               or the PCP. When applied to unrelated subjects, PCH has a
               drawback. For each SNP it is necessary to estimate the vector of
               loadings that maximize the heritability over all phenotypes. We
               develop a method of iterated sample splitting that uses one
               portion of the data for training and the remainder for testing.

               hypothesis is that these GWAS risk loci alter the individual's
               disease risk through their effect on gene expression in
               different tissues. In order to understand the mechanisms driving
               a GWAS risk locus, it is helpful to determine which gene is
               affected in specific tissue types. For example, the relevant
               gene and tissue may play a role in the disease mechanism if the
               same variant responsible for a GWAS locus also affects gene
               expression. Identifying whether or not the same variant is
               causal in both GWAS and eQTL studies is challenging due to the
               uncertainty induced by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the fact
               that some loci harbor multiple causal variants. However, current
               methods that address this problem assume that each locus
               contains a single causal variant. In this paper, we present a
               new method, eCAVIAR, that is capable of accounting for LD while
               computing the quantity we refer to as the colocalization
               posterior probability (CLPP). The CLPP is the probability that
               the same variant is responsible for both the GWAS and eQTL
               signal. eCAVIAR has several key advantages. First, our method
               can account for more than one causal variant in any loci.
               Second, it can leverage summary statistics without accessing the
               individual genotype data. We use both simulated and real
               datasets to demonstrate the utility of our method. Utilizing
               publicly available eQTL data on 45 different tissues, we
               demonstrate that computing CLPP can prioritize likely relevant
               tissues and target genes for a set of Glucose and
               Insulin-related traits loci. eCAVIAR is available at

               thousands of risk loci for many complex traits and diseases, the
               causal variants and genes at these loci remain largely unknown.
               Here, we introduce a method for estimating the local genetic
               correlation between gene expression and a complex trait and
               utilize it to estimate the genetic correlation due to predicted
               expression between pairs of traits. We integrated gene
               expression measurements from 45 expression panels with summary
               GWAS data to perform 30 multi-tissue transcriptome-wide
               association studies (TWASs). We identified 1,196 genes whose
               expression is associated with these traits; of these, 168 reside
               more than 0.5 Mb away from any previously reported GWAS
               significant variant. We then used our approach to find 43 pairs

               predicted expression; of these, eight were not found through
               genetic correlation at the SNP level. Finally, we used

  author    = "Bowden, Jack and Davey Smith, George and Burgess, Stephen",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses
               including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly
               increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide
               association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise
               estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may
               not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them
               having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy).
               METHODS: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple
               instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by
               pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias.
               Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually
               by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger
               regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis,
               can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope
               coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the
               causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each
               genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the
               pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure),
               Egger's test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis
               and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the
               genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables. RESULTS: We
               illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two
               published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect
               of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood
               pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative
               nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples.
               CONCLUSIONS: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call
               MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard
               instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect
               estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach
               provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the
               findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.",

               used as a strategy to improve causal inference in observational
               studies. Availability of summary data of genetic associations
               for a variety of phenotypes from large genome-wide association
               studies (GWAS) allows straightforward application of MR in a
               two-sample design. In addition to the conventional inverse
               variance weighting (IVW) method, recently developed summary data
               MR methods, such as the MR-Egger and weighted median approaches,
               allow a relaxation of the instrumental variable assumptions.
               Methods: Here, a new method - the mode estimator - is proposed
               to obtain a single causal effect estimate from multiple genetic
               instruments. The mode estimate is consistent when the largest
               number of similar (identical in infinite samples)
               individual-instrument causal effect estimates comes from valid
               instruments, even if the majority of instruments are invalid. We
               evaluated the performance of the method in simulations designed
               to mimic the two-sample summary data setting, and demonstrate
               its use by investigating the causal effect of plasma lipid
               fractions and urate levels on coronary heart disease risk.
               Results: The mode estimates presented less bias and type-I error
               rates than other methods under the null in many situations. Its
               power to detect a causal effect was smaller compared to the IVW
               and weighted median methods, but was larger than that of
               MR-Egger regression, with sample size requirements typically
               smaller than those available from GWAS consortia. Conclusions:
               The mode estimator relaxes the instrumental variable
               assumptions, and should be used in combination with other
               approaches in a sensitivity analysis.",

               Genomes) is a widely used approach for increasing power in

               hidden Markov models (HMM)-based imputation approaches require
               individual-level genotypes. Here, we develop a new method for
               Gaussian imputation from summary association statistics, a type
               of data that is becoming widely available. RESULTS:In
               simulations using 1000 Genomes (1000G) data, this method
               recovers 84\% (54\%) of the effective sample size for common
               (>5\%) and low-frequency (1-5\%) variants [increasing to 87\%
               (60\%) when summary linkage disequilibrium information is
               available from target samples] versus the gold standard of 89\%
               (67\%) for HMM-based imputation, which cannot be applied to
               summary statistics. Our approach accounts for the limited sample
               size of the reference panel, a crucial step to eliminate
               false-positive associations, and it is computationally very
               fast. As an empirical demonstration, we apply our method to
               seven case-control phenotypes from the Wellcome Trust Case
               Control Consortium (WTCCC) data and a study of height in the
               British 1958 birth cohort (1958BC). Gaussian imputation from
               summary statistics recovers 95\% (105\%) of the effective sample
               size (as quantified by the ratio of [Formula: see text]
               association statistics) compared with HMM-based imputation from
               individual-level genotypes at the 227 (176) published single
               nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the WTCCC (1958BC height)
               data. In addition, for publicly available summary statistics
               from large meta-analyses of four lipid traits, we publicly
               release imputed summary statistics at 1000G SNPs, which could
               not have been obtained using previously published methods, and
               demonstrate their accuracy by masking subsets of the data. We
               show that 1000G imputation using our approach increases the
               magnitude and statistical evidence of enrichment at genic versus
               non-genic loci for these traits, as compared with an analysis
               without 1000G imputation. Thus, imputation of summary statistics

               approach, intended to be as objective as possible. A probability

               the specification of a family of prior distributions for the
               unknown parameters in the regression model. The method is not
               fully Bayesian, however, because the ultimate choice of prior
               distribution from this family is affected by the data. It is
               assumed that the predictors represent distinct observables; the
               corresponding regression coefficients are assigned independent
               prior distributions. For each regression coefficient subject to
               deletion from the model, the prior distribution is a mixture of
               a point mass at 0 and a diffuse uniform distribution elsewhere,
               that is, a ?spike and slab? distribution. The random error
               component is assigned a normal distribution with mean 0 and
               standard deviation $\sigma$, where ln($\sigma$) has a locally
               uniform noninformative prior distribution. The appropriate
               posterior probabilities are derived for each submodel. If the
               regression coefficients have identical priors, the posterior
               distribution depends only on the data and the parameter ?, which
               is the height of the spike divided by the height of the slab for
               the common prior distribution. This parameter is not assigned a
               probability distribution; instead, it is considered a parameter
               that indexes the members of a class of Bayesian methods.
               Graphical methods are proposed as informal guides for choosing
               ?, assessing the complexity of the response function and the
               strength of the individual predictor variables, and assessing
               the degree of uncertainty about the best submodel. The following
               plots against ? are suggested: (a) posterior probability that a
               particular regression coefficient is 0; (b) posterior expected
               number of terms in the model; (c) posterior entropy of the
               submodel distribution; (d) posterior predictive error; and (e)
               posterior probability of goodness of fit. Plots (d) and (e) are
               suggested as ways to choose y. The predictive error is
               determined using a Bayesian cross-validation approach that
               generates a predictive density for each observation, given all
               of the data except that observation, that is, a type of ?leave
               one out? approach. The goodness-of-fit measure is the sum of the
               posterior probabilities of all submodels that pass a standard F
               test for goodness of fit relative to the full model, at a
               specified level of significance. The dependence of the results
               on the scaling of the variables is discussed, and some ways to
               choose the scaling constants are suggested. Examples based on a
               large data set arising from an energy-conservation study are
               given to demonstrate the application of the methods.",

  abstract  = "Background: Mendelian randomisation (MR) is being increasingly
               used to strengthen causal inference in observational studies.
               Availability of summary data of genetic associations for a
               variety of phenotypes from large genome-wide association studies
               (GWAS) allows straightforward application of MR using summary
               data methods, typically in a two-sample design. In addition to
               the conventional inverse variance weighting (IVW) method,
               recently developed summary data MR methods, such as the MR-Egger
               and weighted median approaches, allow a relaxation of the
               instrumental variable assumptions. Methods: Here, a new method -
               the mode-based estimate (MBE) - is proposed to obtain a single
               causal effect estimate from multiple genetic instruments. The
               MBE is consistent when the largest number of similar (identical
               in infinite samples) individual-instrument causal effect
               estimates comes from valid instruments, even if the majority of
               instruments are invalid. We evaluate the performance of the
               method in simulations designed to mimic the two-sample summary
               data setting, and demonstrate its use by investigating the
               causal effect of plasma lipid fractions and urate levels on
               coronary heart disease risk. Results: The MBE presented less
               bias and type-I error rates than other methods under the null in
               many situations. Its power to detect a causal effect was smaller
               compared to the IVW and weighted median methods, but was larger
               than that of MR-Egger regression, with sample size requirements
               typically smaller than those available from GWAS consortia.
               Conclusions: The MBE relaxes the instrumental variable
               assumptions, and should be used in combination with other
               approaches in a sensitivity analysis.",

              quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data can boost power to detect
              novel disease loci or pinpoint the susceptibility gene at a known
              disease locus. However, it is often the case that multiple eQTL
              genes co-localize at disease loci (an effect of linkage
              disequilibrium, LD), making the identification of the true
              susceptibility gene challenging. To distinguish between true
              susceptibility genes (i.e. when the genetic effect on phenotype
              is mediated through expression) and spurious co-localizations, we
              developed an approach to quantify the genetic effect mediated
              through expression. Our approach can be viewed as an extension of
              the standard Mendelian randomization Egger technique to
              incorporate LD among variants while only requiring summary
              association data (both GWAS and eQTL) along with LD from
              reference panels. Through simulations we show that when eQTLs
              have pleiotropic or LD-confounded effects on disease, our
              approach provides adequate control of Type I error, more power,
              and less bias than previously-proposed methods. When there is no
              effect of gene expression on disease, our method has the desired
              Type I Error, while LD-aware Mendelian randomization, which
              assumes no pleiotropy, can have inflated Type I Error. In the
              presence of direct effect of genetic variants on traits, our
              approach attained up to 3x greater power than the standard
              approaches while properly controlling Type I error. To illustrate
              our method, we analyzed recent large scale breast cancer GWAS

               Results from twin, family and adoption studies are consistent
               with general intelligence being highly heritable and genetically
               stable throughout the life course. No robustly associated
               genetic loci or variants for childhood intelligence have been

               study (GWAS) on childhood intelligence (age range 6-18 years)
               from 17[thinsp]989 individuals in six discovery and three
               replication samples. Although no individual single-nucleotide
               polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected with genome-wide
               significance, we show that the aggregate effects of common SNPs
               explain 22-46\% of phenotypic variation in childhood
               intelligence in the three largest cohorts (P=3.9 [times] 10-15,
               0.014 and 0.028). FNBP1L, previously reported to be the most
               significantly associated gene for adult intelligence, was also
               significantly associated with childhood intelligence (P=0.003).
               Polygenic prediction analyses resulted in a significant
               correlation between predictor and outcome in all replication
               cohorts. The proportion of childhood intelligence explained by

               results are consistent with expectations if the genetic
               architecture of childhood intelligence is like that of body mass
               index or height. Our study provides molecular support for the
               heritability and polygenic nature of childhood intelligence.

  abstract = "IMPORTANCE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent,
              serious public health concern, particularly in the military. The
              identification of genetic risk factors for PTSD may provide
              important insights into the biological foundation of
              vulnerability and comorbidity. OBJECTIVE: To discover genetic
              loci associated with the lifetime risk for PTSD in 2 cohorts from
              the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers
              (Army STARRS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two coordinated
              genome-wide association studies of mental health in the US
              military contributed participants. The New Soldier Study (NSS)
              included 3167 unique participants with PTSD and 4607
              trauma-exposed control individuals; the Pre/Post Deployment Study
              (PPDS) included 947 unique participants with PTSD and 4969
              trauma-exposed controls. The NSS data were collected from
              February 1, 2011, to November 30, 2012; the PDDS data, from
              January 9 to April 30, 2012. The primary analysis compared
              lifetime DSM-IV PTSD cases with trauma-exposed controls without
              lifetime PTSD. Data were analyzed from March 18 to December 27,
              2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association analyses for PTSD
              used logistic regression models within each of 3 ancestral groups
              (European, African, and Latino American) by study, followed by
              meta-analysis. Heritability and genetic correlation and
              pleiotropy with other psychiatric and immune-related disorders
              were estimated. RESULTS: The NSS population was 80.7\% male (6277
              of 7774 participants; mean [SD] age, 20.9 [3.3] years); the PPDS
              population, 94.4\% male (5583 of 5916 participants; mean [SD]
              age, 26.5 [6.0] years). A genome-wide significant locus was found
              in ANKRD55 on chromosome 5 (rs159572; odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95\%
              CI, 1.37-1.92; P = 2.34 $\times$ 10-8) and persisted after
              adjustment for cumulative trauma exposure (adjusted OR, 1.64;
              95\% CI, 1.39-1.95; P = 1.18 $\times$ 10-8) in the African
              American samples from the NSS. A genome-wide significant locus
              was also found in or near ZNF626 on chromosome 19 (rs11085374;
              OR, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.70-0.85; P = 4.59 $\times$ 10-8) in the
              European American samples from the NSS. Similar results were not
              found for either single-nucleotide polymorphism in the
              corresponding ancestry group from the PPDS sample, in other
              ancestral groups, or in transancestral meta-analyses.
              Single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability was
              nonsignificant, and no significant genetic correlations were
              observed between PTSD and 6 mental disorders or 9 immune-related
              disorders. Significant evidence of pleiotropy was observed
              between PTSD and rheumatoid arthritis and, to a lesser extent,
              psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the largest genome-wide
              association study of PTSD to date, involving a US military
              sample, limited evidence of association for specific loci was
              found. Further efforts are needed to replicate the genome-wide
              significant association with ANKRD55-associated in prior research
              with several autoimmune and inflammatory disorders-and to clarify
              the nature of the genetic overlap observed between PTSD and
              rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample
              size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were
              later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple
              test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results
              when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed
              the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. DESIGN:
              Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis
              and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if
              effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate
              was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37
              meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading
              general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the
              second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.
              MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured
              by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates
              against precision. RESULTS: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis
              and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular
              medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric
              medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant
              and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to
              meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was
              present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of
              concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%)
              Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was
              bias. CONCLUSIONS: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a
              useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but
              as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses
              are based on a limited number of small trials the results from
              such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.",

              Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)-supported collaboration of four
              groups accessing eight extensively characterized epidemiologic

  abstract = "Motivation: Epidemiological cohorts typically contain a diverse
              set of phenotypes such that automation of phenome scans is
              non-trivial, because they require highly heterogeneous models.
              For this reason, phenome scans have to date tended to use a
              smaller homogeneous set of phenotypes that can be analysed in a
              consistent fashion. We present PHESANT (PHEnome Scan ANalysis
              Tool), a software package for performing comprehensive phenome
              scans in UK Biobank. General features: PHESANT tests the
              association of a specified trait with all continuous, integer and
              categorical variables in UK Biobank, or a specified subset.
              PHESANT uses a novel rule-based algorithm to determine how to
              appropriately test each trait, then performs the analyses and
              produces plots and summary tables. Implementation: The PHESANT
              phenome scan is implemented in R. PHESANT includes a novel
              Javascript D3.js visualization and accompanying Java code that
              converts the phenome scan results to the required JavaScript
              Object Notation (JSON) format. Availability: PHESANT is available
              on GitHub at [https://github.com/MRCIEU/PHESANT]. Git tag v0.5

  abstract = "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous
              associations between genetic loci and individual phenotypes;
              however, relatively few GWAS have attempted to detect pleiotropic
              associations, in which loci are simultaneously associated with
              multiple distinct phenotypes. We show that pleiotropic
              associations can be directly modeled via the construction of
              simple Bayesian networks, and that these models can be applied to
              produce single or ensembles of Bayesian classifiers that leverage
              pleiotropy to improve genetic risk prediction. The proposed
              method includes two phases: (1) Bayesian model comparison, to
              identify Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with
              one or more traits; and (2) cross-validation feature selection,
              in which a final set of SNPs is selected to optimize prediction.
              To demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of the method, a
              total of 1600 case-control GWAS datasets with two dichotomous
              phenotypes were simulated under 16 scenarios, varying the
              association strengths of causal SNPs, the size of the discovery
              sets, the balance between cases and controls, and the number of
              pleiotropic causal SNPs. Across the 16 scenarios, prediction
              accuracy varied from 90 to 50\%. In the 14 scenarios that
              included pleiotropically associated SNPs, the pleiotropic model
              search and prediction methods consistently outperformed the naive
              model search and prediction. In the two scenarios in which there
              were no true pleiotropic SNPs, the differences between the
              pleiotropic and naive model searches were minimal. To further
              evaluate the method on real data, a discovery set of 1071 sickle
              cell disease (SCD) patients was used to search for pleiotropic
              associations between cerebral vascular accidents and fetal
              hemoglobin level. Classification was performed on a smaller
              validation set of 352 SCD patients, and showed that the inclusion
              of pleiotropic SNPs may slightly improve prediction, although the
              difference was not statistically significant. The proposed method
              is robust, computationally efficient, and provides a powerful new
              approach for detecting and modeling pleiotropic disease loci.",

              disease locus. However, it is often the case that multiple eQTL

              developed an approach to quantify the genetic effect mediated

              Type I Error, while LD-aware Mendelian randomization, which
              assumes no pleiotropy, can have inflated Type I Error. In the
              presence of direct effect of genetic variants on traits, our
              approach attained up to 3x greater power than the standard
              approaches while properly controlling Type I error. To illustrate

              Here, we introduce a method for estimating the local genetic
              correlation between gene expression and a complex trait and
              utilize it to estimate the genetic correlation due to predicted

              estimation and bias detection through Egger regression",
  author   = "Bowden, Jack and Davey Smith, George and Burgess, Stephen",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses
              including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly
              increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide
              association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise
              estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may
              not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them
              having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy).
              METHODS: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple
              instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by
              pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias.
              Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually
              by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression,
              a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be
              adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope
              coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the
              causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each
              genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the
              pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger's
              test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a
              consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic
              variants are invalid instrumental variables. RESULTS: We
              illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published
              Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on
              lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on
              coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this
              approach is illustrated with these examples. CONCLUSIONS: An
              adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect
              some violations of the standard instrumental variable
              assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject
              to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis
              for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization
              investigation.",

  abstract = "Inference about the causal structure that induces correlations
              between two traits can be achieved by combining genetic
              associations with a mediation-based approach, as is done in the
              causal inference test (CIT). However, we show that measurement
              error in the phenotypes can lead to the CIT inferring the wrong
              causal direction, and that increasing sample sizes has the
              adverse effect of increasing confidence in the wrong answer. This
              problem is likely to be general to other mediation-based
              approaches. Here we introduce an extension to Mendelian
              randomisation, a method that uses genetic associations in an
              instrumentation framework, that enables inference of the causal
              direction between traits, with some advantages. First, it can be
              performed using only summary level data from genome-wide
              association studies; second, it is less susceptible to bias in
              the presence of measurement error or unmeasured confounding. We
              apply the method to infer the causal direction between DNA
              methylation and gene expression levels. Our results demonstrate
              that, in general, DNA methylation is more likely to be the causal
              factor, but this result is highly susceptible to bias induced by
              systematic differences in measurement error between the
              platforms, and by horizontal pleiotropy. We emphasise that, where
              possible, implementing MR and appropriate sensitivity analyses

              triangulate reliable conclusions about causality.",
